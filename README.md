### Introduction 📚

For my high school dissertation project, I tackled a recurring challenge from our "Business Economics" book exercises: manually creating profit and loss statements and balance sheets based on various input details. The task, while straightforward, was repetitive and time-consuming, with only slight variations depending on the exercise (they were repetitive on purpose, as that's the goal of homework 😅). So, I decided to make it more intresting 😎

### Solution 💡

To optimize this process, I developed an application using PHP and MariaDB that could automatically generate these financial statements. By implementing the algorithms and logic I had studied, I was able to create a tool that accurately produced the necessary reports based on the provided input details.

### Project Duration ⏳

This project took six months to complete and involved a substantial data collection process. I enlisted the support of some friends who were interested in learning SQL, which not only helped expedite the data collection but also fostered a collaborative learning environment.

## Features 🛠️

#### Program Assistance 🧑‍🏫

BilancioEA assists students during their exercises by providing a series of pre-made exercises that can be compared with the student's work to facilitate understanding and correction.

#### Sharing Made Simple 🔗

Sharing an exercise is easy—just scan a QR code! Alternatively, a direct link to the selected exercise is always available.

#### Easy Creation ✏️

Creating an exercise is simple. Just enter all the accounts from the exercise you intend to create and add it to the list! (This requires a special access code available only to teachers.)

#### Advantages ⏱️

Using this program significantly optimizes the time available for correcting assigned exercises. Drafting the statements on the board takes an average of 15 minutes per statement, whereas BilancioEA takes less than 2 seconds.
